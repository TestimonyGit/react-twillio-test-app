# react-twillio-test-app
App for test task from TrueCare

Task - to create an admin dashboard with provided designs and to implement a call button to connect admin and a user via twilio.

Build & run server with `npm run run-server`. You'll need node.js installed globally.
Add your own credentials to `server/credentials.json` to enable twilio call functionality. Project assumes that admin is logged in, so admin's phone has to be set up manually.
